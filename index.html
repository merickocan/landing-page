                    Alternative rock (also known as 
                    alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a category of
                    rock music that evolved from the independent music underground of

                    Punk rock (also known as simply punk) is a music genre that emerged 
                    in the mid-1970s. Rooted in 1950s rock and roll[2][3][4] and 
                    1960s garage rock, punk bands rejected the corporate nature of mainstream 
                    1970s rock music.

                    in the early 1970s and was primarily defined by the flamboyant clothing,
